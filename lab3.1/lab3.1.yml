# come up with an original name for your new langauge - extending truffle
language_name: choco

# explain a little what inspired your language and why it's cool
language_explanation: |
    Truffle chocolates are named after truffle mushrooms because they look similar. But that is where it stops.
    As such, since I am extending truffle, it will look like truffle, but they will be inherently different in their abilities.
